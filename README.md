# Fork Info
This is a new repository which will be maintained for the forseeable future.

# Info
This repository allows the extension of the BONELAB Marrow SDK, allowing you to create custom guns and other types of items not yet supported by the Marrow SDK.

One of the major objectives of this repo, is to remove incentives to decompile the game, through strategic inclusion of assets which aren't useful elsewhere, and thorough documentation of what's possible.

# How to Install

Install the MarrowSDK by following the original steps at https://github.com/StressLevelZero/MarrowSDK/wiki/ProjectSetup.

### IMPORTANT!! DO NOT INSTALL THE MARROWSDK PACKAGE AFTER ADDING THE SCOPED REGISTRY!!

After you've added the scoped registry, go to the top left of the ``Package Manager`` and add a ``git URL``.
The git URL you should add is ``https://github.com/volx64/MarrowSDKExt-Labworks.git``.

If you've done everything correctly, everything should install properly. Including SLZ's URP.

After you've installed the MarrowSDK, download this repository from the green dropdown arrow. Then drop it into your Assets folder.
